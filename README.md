# Cloud Service Certification

Enable banks to use services provided by AWS, Azure and Google in a way that meets existing regulatory and internal security controls.

# Project Kanban
Find the [Cloud Service Certification Project Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/1) in the parent FINOS organisation on GitHub.

# Project Wiki
We're currently migrating Cloud Service Certification reference materials from the FINOS wiki to the Cloud Service Certification GitHub wiki.

Please use the links below to find Cloud Service Certification materials. 

* **Migrating From FINOS Wiki :** 
  * [Cloud Service Certification FINOS Wiki](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FDX/pages/904626436/Cloud+Service+Certification+Project) 
* **Migrating To GitHub Wiki :** 
  * [Cloud Service Cerification GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/finos/cloud-service-certification/wiki)


# Project Structure
The project is expected to grow to cover the different CSP (Cloud Service Providers) and in turn services for each of the providers. The project structure maps this hierarchy of CSPs -> Services.

Each service folder will contain markdown files (the service control description), test cases documentation and ultimately infrastructure-as-code (e.g. cloud formation or Terraform configuration). Where applicable, pre-existing source documents (e.g. docx) are stored within "archive" folders under the indidivual service folders.

## Service Approval Accelerator

The [Service Approval Accelerator](https://github.com/finos/cloud-service-certification/blob/master/templates/ServiceApprovalAcceleratorTemplate.md) describes each service contributed to Cloud Service Certification alongside test cases and infrastructure as code.

A single [Service Approval Accelerator](https://github.com/finos/cloud-service-certification/blob/master/templates/ServiceApprovalAcceleratorTemplate.md) document should be contributed with every service contributed to Cloud Service Certifcation. 

_See AWS Redshift example below_.

## Contributed Cloud Service by Example, AWS Redshift

The [AWS RedShift Service Definition](https://github.com/finos/cloud-service-certification/tree/master/aws/redshift) has been created to demonstrate through example the assets required with each service contribution to Cloud Service Certification.

* [Redshift Test Cases](https://github.com/finos/cloud-service-certification/blob/master/aws/redshift/RedshiftTestCases.md) : 
  * A document containing test cases from the point of view of AWS Redshift. 
* [Redshift Service Approval Accelerator](https://github.com/finos/cloud-service-certification/blob/master/aws/redshift/ServiceApprovalAcceleratorRedshift.md) : 
  * A document containing the Service Approval Accelerator from the point of view of AWS Redshift.
* [The Redshift Service Definition](https://github.com/finos/cloud-service-certification/blob/master/aws/redshift/redshift_template_public.yml) : 
  * A YAML file containing the description of the AWS Redshift service as code.

# Tips

## Converting DocX to Markdown
After several tests, the best results to convert input .docx (Microsoft Word Documents) was achieved by using the Pandoc cmdline tool using the gfm (Github flavored Markdown) as output format. 

For example, after [installing Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html#), using [templates/archive/ServiceApprovalAccelerator_template_draftrelease.docx](templates/archive/ServiceApprovalAccelerator_template_draftrelease.docx) as input, we obtain  as output [templates/ServiceApprovalAcceleratorTemplate.md](templates/ServiceApprovalAcceleratorTemplate.md) with the following command: 

`pandoc -s ServiceApprovalAccelerator_template_draftrelease.docx -t gfm -o ServiceApprovalAcceleratorTemplate.md`

See [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16383237/how-can-doc-docx-files-be-converted-to-markdown-or-structured-text) for reference.
